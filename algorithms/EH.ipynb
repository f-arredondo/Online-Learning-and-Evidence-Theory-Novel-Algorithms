        "The EH class implements a learning algorithm with multiple SGDClassifier experts and a perfect expert. Initially, it assigns equal mass to each expert. It makes aggregated predictions based on the experts' outputs. If the coarsened prediction results in an abstention, the experts' masses are updated according to their prediction accuracy using the Dempster-Shafer rule (a refined mass of 1 is assigned to the set of experts who were correct, while those who were incorrect receive mass of 0). The goal is to aggregate predictions in adversarial settings and minimize errors through dynamic mass updates."
