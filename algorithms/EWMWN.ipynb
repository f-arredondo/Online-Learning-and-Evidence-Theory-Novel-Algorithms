        "# The Evidence Weighted Majority with Normalization Algorithm (EWMWN)\n",
        "The EWMWN class implements a learning algorithm with multiple SGDClassifier experts. Initially, it assigns equal mass to each expert. It makes aggregated predictions based on the experts' outputs. If the coarsened prediction results in an error, the masses of incorrect experts are reduced by a factor of beta  and then all the experts' masses are normalized to maintain the sum of the masses at 1. No updates are made when all experts agree, as the situation is uninformative. The goal is to aggregate predictions in adversarial settings and minimize errors through dynamic mass updates."
